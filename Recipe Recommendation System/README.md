# Recipe Recommendation System

This project implements a recipe recommendation system content based on user-provided ingredients. The system utilizes cosine similarity and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to suggest recipes similar to the user's input.

## Overview

The recipe recommendation system allows users to input a list of ingredients, and it recommends recipes from a dataset that match or are similar to the provided ingredients. The recommendations include details such as recipe names, ingredients, nutritional information, images and videos.

## Features

- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommendations are based on the similarity between user-input ingredients and recipes in the dataset.
- **Cosine Similarity:** Calculates similarity scores using cosine similarity metric.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Vectorizes ingredients using TF-IDF for text representation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/recipe-recommendation-system.git
   cd recipe-recommendation-system
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```

## Usage

1. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/recommend_recipes` with the following JSON payload:
   ```json
   {
     "ingredients": "chicken, cheese, tomato"
   }
   ```

2. View the recipe recommendations in the response.
