Recipe Recommendation API
This project implements a recipe recommendation API using FastAPI. Given a list of ingredients, the API recommends recipes based on cosine similarity and TF-IDF vectorization of the recipe ingredients.

Features
Recipe Recommendation: Input a list of ingredients to receive recommended recipes.
Cosine Similarity: Utilizes cosine similarity for content-based recommendation.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Ingredients are vectorized using TF-IDF for similarity calculation.
Error Handling: Handles errors gracefully during recipe recommendation.
